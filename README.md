# Getting started

## Prerequisites

Ruby on Rails and MongoDB must be installed and configured. The package manager of choice is `yarn`.

## Installation

(Outside the project's dir):

`gem install foreman`

(Inside):

`yarn install`

Server start (make sure mongod is running and accepting connections):

`foreman start -f Procfile.dev -p 3000`

## Usage

Deploy the project and launch the server using the instructions above. Open the application in a browser and click the "Spreadsheet" button either in the header or in the sidebar.

The Spreadsheet page will appear with a single button "Add column".
Click it, choose the title for the new column, its type, and whether it will be a required column.
Then click "Save".

A table will appear with the newly created column title and a "?" button beside it.
"?" button allows you to apply a filter to the column, but there should be some rows to filter first.
Below the table will be a button labeled "Add 10 rows", which does just that, 10 new empty rows will be appended to the table body.

After the table is populated with rows, you can add more columns of different types, or edit the rows, assigning them values according to the column's type.
Now each column can be assigned a filter and the table will only show those items that pass through all filters.
Filters may be temporarily switched off by the checkbox above the table, or completely reset by clicking the "Reset filters" button nearby.
Both of these elements appear only after the table is populated with rows.
