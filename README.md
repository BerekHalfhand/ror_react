## Installation

(Outside the project's dir):

`gem install foreman`

(Inside):

`yarn install`

Server start (make sure mongod is running and accepting connections):

`foreman start -f Procfile.dev -p 3000`

## Usage

Deploy the project, launch the server, open the application in a browser and click "Spreadsheet" button either in the header or in the sidebar.
The Spreadsheet page will appear with a single button "Add column".
Click it, choose the title for the new column, its type, and whether it will be a required column.
Then click "Save".
A table will appear with the newly created column title and a "?" button beside it.
"?" button allows you to apply a filter to the column, but there should be some rows to filter first.
Below the table will be a button labeled "Add 10 rows", which does just that, 10 new empty rows will be appended to the table body.
